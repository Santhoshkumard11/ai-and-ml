## Domain
We have selected the domain of communication for our project.<br/>
## Synopsis
We are working towards utilizing deep learning concepts to develop a robust face recognition system that can work on images/videos. Once the network recognises face, we aim towards implementing facial expression recognition, mask detection (whether a person is wearing a mask or not) and hand gesture recognition systems. <br/>
The milestones for this project are:<br/>
* Read and display image using opencv and python3,<br/>
* Read and display webcam using opencv and python3,<br/>
* Face detection using haar cascade on an image,<br/>
* Overview of google colab or installation of deep learning framework (pytorch, tensorflow etc) on personal computer,<br/>
* MNIST dataset training/testing using pytorch,<br/>
* Face detection based on CNNs/YOLOs,<br/>
* Emotion recognition in the detected faces,<br/>
* Mask detection in the detected faces,<br/> 
* Human detection based on CNNs/YOLOs,<br/>
* Hand gesture recognition.<br/>

## Project Title : Classification of Trash for Recyclability Status

Abstract : A computer vision approach to classifying garbage into recycling categories could be an efficient way to process waste. The objective of this project is to take images of a single piece of recycling or garbage and classify it into six classes consisting of glass, paper, metal, plastic, cardboard, and trash. We will create a dataset that contains around 400-500 images for each class. We plan to release this dataset for the public. Some of the models to be used are support vector machines (SVM) with scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) features and a convolutional neural network (CNN).This model can be wrapped in an app for better utility.

June Milestone : Every participant should build some basic ML models using publicly available dataset and submit as a part of their Juneâ€™s assignment

#### July 1-15: Data collection,data preprocessing part.Participants will search Google datasets for collecting data and can create their own.
------------------------------------------------------------
#### July 15- Doubt clearing meeting.
------------------------------------------------------------
#### July 16-30 : Explore object recognition algorithms. Dive deeper into concepts of CNN and Yolo etc. 
------------------------------------------------------------
#### July 31- Doubt clearing meeting.
------------------------------------------------------------
July Milestone : A complete preprocessed dataset with labelled images. Implementation of some initial models on the dataset if possible. 

#### August 1-15: Implement various algorithms studied in past months on the dataset and evaluate the model on test data. Improve accuracy of model.
------------------------------------------------------------
#### Aug 15- Doubt clearing meeting.
------------------------------------------------------------
August 16 - 30: Deployment of the model in the web using flask framework.

August Milestone : Trained model and flask framework to consume the model.



### Note:
-> We plan to divide our project into sprints of 15 days.  
-> Regular meetings will be held on bi-weekly basis to discuss the progress of participants.  
-> A github repository will be maintained where participants will add their work after every sprint.
